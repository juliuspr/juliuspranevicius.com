## Progressive Etudes (five volumes)

I have developed this etude collection for students in their 1st and 2nd year of their studies. This systematic progression helps to cover important topics: breathing technique, efficient sound production, phrasing and interpretation. The student is supposed to learn a new etude every week. This way the student develops effective practice strategies and the ability to learn fast.

Work with one volume takes about one semester. Once a volume is completed, the student gets an experience mastery at the end of semester.

## Progressive Orchestra Excerpts (four volumes)

My collection of Orchestra Excerpts is based on the same philosophy as the etudes (see above). Each volume has 12 excerpts for one semester.

The level of technical difficulty in the first volume is relatively low, and the student can focus on acquiring learning skills, like listening to recordings, working on phrasing. By Vol. 4 the student will have covered most of the technical challenges. The student is challenged to develop different playing styles required by the different excerpts.

The excerpts are put together in a way that gives possibility for playing in groups. This helps to develop the skills of taking different roles in the section.

To facilitate student active learning, I have developed a worksheet for each excerpt. The students have to do their research to fill the worksheet: they have to make decisions on artistic and technical issues.

## Low Horn Book

I have developed this collection for students to have more variety in their low horn studies. In addition to providing material for improving the low range, this collection is a good tool for practicing sight reading in bass clef.
